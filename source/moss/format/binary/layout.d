 * A LayoutEntry is a multipart key that defines the origin of

 * The corresponding value of the key will contain two values,
 * the origin, and the target. In all regular file cases, the
 * origin will be a hash ID so that files may be linked out from
 * the system hash store.
 *
 * In the instance of directories, the origin will be blank and skipped.
 * In the case of symlinks, the origin will be the source of the symlink.
 * And finally, for special files (mkdev) the origin will be the uint32_t
 * device number encoded as a uint32_t.
 *
 * The tag field is reserved for internal use, allowing individual paths
 * to be flagged as a certain *kind* of file, which may in turn trigger
 * some kind of action.
